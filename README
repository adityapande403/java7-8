The Java program includes two codes:

A program to find the factorial of n integers by reading the integers as command line arguments (CLA) with a custom exception class "FactorialException" to validate input values.
A program to demonstrate the use of a custom exception class "NOMATCHEXCP" that is thrown when the string from the keyboard is not equal to "India".
